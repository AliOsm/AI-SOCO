    I miss the taste of a sweeter life
    I miss the conversation
    I’m searching for a song tonight
    I’m changing all of the stations

    I like to think that we had it all
    We drew a map to a better place
    But on that road I took a fall
    Oh baby why did you run away?

    I was there for you
    In your darkest times
    I was there for you
    In your darkest nights

    But I wonder where were you?
    When I was at my worst
    Down on my knees
    And you said you had my back
    So I wonder where were you?
    When all the roads you took came back to me

    So I’m following the map that leads to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
    The map that leads to you
    Following, following, following to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
    The map that leads to you
    Following, following, following

    I hear your voice in my sleep at night
    Hard to resist temptation
    'Cause something strange has come over me
    And now I can’t get over you
    No, I just can’t get over you

    I was there for you
    In your darkest times
    I was there for you
    In your darkest nights

    But I wonder where were you?
    When I was at my worst
    Down on my knees
    And you said you had my back
    So I wonder where were you?
    When all the roads you took came back to me

    So I’m following the map that leads to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
    The map that leads to you
    Following, following, following to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
    The map that leads to you

    Oh oh oh
    Oh oh oh
    Yeah yeah yeah
    Oh oh oh

    Oh, I was there for you
    Oh, in your darkest time
    Oh, I was there for you
    Oh, in your darkest nights

    Oh, I was there for you
    Oh, in your darkest time
    Oh, I was there for you
    Oh, in your darkest nights

    But I wonder where were you?
    When I was at my worst
    Down on my knees
    And you said you had my back
    So I wonder where were you?
    When all the roads you took came back to me

    So I’m following the map that leads to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
    The map that leads to you
    Following, following, following to you
    The map that leads to you
    Ain't nothing I can do
