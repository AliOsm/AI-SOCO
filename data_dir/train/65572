Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby do you recognise me?
Oh well, it's been a year it doesn't suprise me
Happy Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you' I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I gave you love last Christmas
Right from the heart
You'll never find a love again

The face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I found a new love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
(I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
(Save me from these tears)
I'll give it to someone special
