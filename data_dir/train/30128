	 * Answer for n is n-2 (Only 2 people leave).
	 *
	 * Proof :
	 *
	 * First :
	 *  	Proof that they can't be less than 2 who leave :
	 *
	 *  		Obviously, they can't be 0, as each person must have number of friends
	 *  		between 0 and n-1, so at some point at least one must leave.
	 *
	 *  		However, they also can't be just one who leave.
	 *  		Proof by contradiction:
	 *
	 *  			Let that only one who left had x friends so he'll leave at moment x.
	 *  			Then all the people must have at least x+1 friends before he leaves -------> (1)
	 *  			because if they had less than that they would leave,
	 *  		 	and after he leaves people will be divide into 2 categories:
	 *  		 	His friends will have number of friends between (x,n-2)
	 *  		 	Others will have number of friends between (x+1,n-1)
	 *
	 *  		 	As you see, if there were others then at least one of them must leave
	 *  		 	because we're now at the moment where who has exactly x+1 friends leaves,
	 *  		 	then who has x+2 leaves,,, till n-1. Hence at least one the others must leave.
	 *  		 	Therefore, there can't be others. All of the people must be his friends
	 *  		 	and have exactly x+1 friends including him so that after he leaves at moment x
	 *  		 	they'll have exactly x friends and will stay till the end.
	 *  		 	Since there can't be others, x must be n-1 so that all the people are his friends.
	 *  		 	However, as in (1), all the people must have at least x+1 friends,
	 *  		 	which means they must have at least n friends out of n-1 people, which is
	 *  		 	impossible! That's contradiction :D
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Second :
	 * 		Proof that for every n > 1 , it is possible that only 2 people leave: 
	 * 		
	 * 			Simply, let all people have each others as friends,
	 * 			which means that everyone has n-1 friends,
	 * 			then let 2 of them not be friends (I'm not sure this sentence is grammatically correct):D
	 *			So only 2 of the n people will have n-2 friends and the rest have n-1 friends okay? 
	 * 			At the moment when people who have n-2 friends leave, those 2 will leave,
	 * 			and the other people who were having n-1 friends including these 2, will have 
	 * 			n-3 friends after these 2 leave, so they'll stay till the end. 
	 * 		
	 * 		
	 * 										------DONE------
